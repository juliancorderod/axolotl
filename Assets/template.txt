I don't quite remember when it started, but I began to see this strange thing every day...
We met across the glass, and I _.|Remaining so still, it _.|With its expressionless face, I _ and did not feel judged.
Its _ eyes drew me into a mystery..|Looking at my reflection, I felt _.|Is it _? 
I began to notice changes every time I saw it. There was a single _ rock.|Translucent,_ seaweed.|More _ faces began to stare with it.|But never as long, and never as close.

I haven’t seen it since then.|When I looked for it, it was gone.|I heard its words, but did it hear mine?|I find myself surrounded by new eyes, but they don't stare like you.
