I don't remember how or when it started, but I started seeing it every day...
We met across the glass.|Remaining so still, it _.|With its expressionless face, I _ and did not feel judged.
Its _ eyes drew me into a mystery.|Looking at my reflection, I felt _.|Is it _?
There was a single _ rock.|Translucent, _ seaweed.|More _ faces began to stare with it.|But never as long, and never as close.
Why do _ stare?|Everyday _ would stay and look at me for hours, judging me.|But staring with _ feels close.
The eyes I became addicted to started to look like my own.|They were _, _, and _.|In front of those eyes, I was _.
The new log seems _.|Does it feel _ now that the coral has moved?|Does it like its _ home?|Home makes me feel _.
I wonder if it can recognize me now.|I don’t think I can never forget its _.|But does it feel the same way?

The _ between us started to disappear.|I’m face to face with it.|And I’m still lost in its eyes.
I looked into its eyes and the mystery became clear.|The words it has been telling _ began to ring in my head.|“Save _.”|“Save _.”
The stillness between us became silent words. It was hard to find an understanding in tranquility. But I find myself waiting to hear your silent voice again.
