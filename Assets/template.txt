I don't quite remember when it started, but I began to see this strange thing every day...
There were so many of them, but there was one that always stood still.|Every time I saw it, our eyes _.|Being different made me not feel _.
I was pulled in by its soulless eyes and the mysteries they held.|Is it _?|Does it feel _?
I began to notice changes every time I saw it. There were shiny _.|Green _.|Other _ began to stare with it. But never as long, and never as close.
Why do _ stare?|The _ would stay and look at me for hours, making me feel judged.|But staring with _ feels close.
They were _, _, and _.|Those eyes always looked like they _. 
Its home looks different from when I first saw it.|More _ surrounded it. New _ were there.|Does it like its home?  
I wonder if it can recognize me now.|I don’t think I can never forget its _.|But does it feel the same way?
I feel like we are beginning to understand each other’s _.|Or maybe I’m just putting my _ in their place.|But I’m starting to think that our _ are the same.
The _ around me began turning into _.|I'm face to face with it.|And I'm still lost in its eyes. 
I looked into its eyes and the mystery behind them became clear to me. The words it has been telling me since the first day began to ring in my head.|"Save _."      "Save _."
It walked out of the aquarium one final time, and I never saw it again...
